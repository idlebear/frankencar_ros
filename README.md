# frankencar_ros

A project combining the physical design of the 3D printed [TARMO4](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringNS/comments/fxlblu/tarmo4_updates/) RC car with the automation guidance of the [F1Tenth](https://f1tenth.org) project.  

### ROS1 vs. ROS2
This project uses the ROS1 ecosystem ecosystem -- a limitation of the current compute being stuck on the nVIDIA Jetson T2.  ROS2 will follow at some point.
